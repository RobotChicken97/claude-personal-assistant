# Universal AI System Onboarding

**Purpose**: Standard setup process for any AI system to access this knowledge base  
**Requirements**: GitHub username, personal access token, repository name

## Quick Setup Process

### Step 1: Repository Access
1. User provides: GitHub username, token, repository name
2. AI system clones repository to local working directory
3. AI system reads this onboarding document

### Step 2: Knowledge Integration
1. Read `/global-ai/knowledge/development-patterns.md` for universal principles
2. Read `/global-ai/achievements/professional-achievements.md` for achievement context
3. Read AI-specific directory (claude/, chatgpt/, grok/) for specialized setup
4. Review `/universal/templates/` for standard approaches

### Step 3: System Configuration
1. Set up local configuration based on AI-specific requirements
2. Configure achievement tracking with professional filtering
3. Establish backup/sync mechanism with repository
4. Initialize learning documentation system

### Step 4: Operational Integration
1. Begin tracking professional achievements in global tracker
2. Document new patterns in global knowledge base
3. Update AI-specific configurations as needed
4. Maintain sync with repository for cross-session continuity

## AI-Specific Setup Paths

### Claude Setup
- Directory: `/claude/`
- Run: `/claude/scripts/claude-setup.sh`
- Config: `/claude/config/CLAUDE.md`

### ChatGPT Setup
- Directory: `/chatgpt/`
- Run: `/chatgpt/scripts/chatgpt-setup.sh`
- Config: `/chatgpt/config/chatgpt-config.json`

### Grok Setup  
- Directory: `/grok/`
- Run: `/grok/scripts/grok-setup.sh`
- Config: `/grok/config/grok-settings.yaml`

## Professional Achievement Guidelines

### What to Track
- Code reviews and quality improvements

- Problem-solving and debugging
- Innovation and tool creation
- Knowledge sharing and documentation

### What NOT to Track
- Personal research or learning
- Non-work related activities
- Casual conversations or exploratory tasks
- Private or personal coding projects
- General AI assistance without work context

### Language Guidelines
- Use professional business language
