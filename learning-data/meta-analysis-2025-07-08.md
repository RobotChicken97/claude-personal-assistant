## Recurring Error Patterns Analysis

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Contradiction Found**: Found 7 instances
   - This suggests a recurring pattern that needs systematic prevention

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Redundant**: Found 2 instances
   - This suggests a recurring pattern that needs systematic prevention

## High-Impact Learning Identification

üìä **Learning Impact Metrics:**
- Critical/Mandatory learnings: 13
- Global scope learnings: 3

üéØ **Recent High-Impact Learnings:**
BEFORE making changes to fix linting/tool warnings:
--

### CRITICAL: CLAUDE.md File Management
**ALWAYS read existing CLAUDE.md content BEFORE adding new information**:
1. **Search for existing sections** that might contain related information
2. **Update existing entries** rather than creating duplicates
3. **Consolidate information** to prevent file bloat
--
**Resolution**: Original intent was to add cache metrics monitoring - removing fields broke core functionality
**Updated Understanding**: NEVER make changes to fix tool warnings without first investigating what the original code was trying to achieve
**Methodology Impact**: Added mandatory step: "Before fixing any tool warnings, investigate original intent by checking git history and understanding the purpose"

### [2025-07-07] - Test Redundancy
--

#### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (MANDATORY)
```
When given a PR to review:
1. **Read project-specific review guidelines** from local CLAUDE.md
